### Why, again, a f*cking new Archey fork ?

The answer is [here](https://horlogeskynet.github.io/Archey4).

### What do I need to get and use this script ?

Required packages:

* python3
* lsb-release

Optional packages:

* wmctrl

### Installation procedure

```
$  git clone https://github.com/HorlogeSkynet/Archey4.git
$  cd Archey4/
$  chmod +x archey
#  cp archey /usr/bin/archey
```

### Usage

```
$  archey
```

### Notes

* If you run `archey` as root, the script will list the processes running by other users of your system in order to display correctly Window Manager & Desktop Environment outputs.

* During the procedure I advise you to copy this binary into the `/usr/bin/` folder, you may want to check what it does thus.
